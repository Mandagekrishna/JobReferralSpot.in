Here i am going to suggest Reference books with GATE point of view and also Academics.

As GATE has very few subjects as compared to Engineering Syllabus and many subjects of academics don't need reference books.

The subjects covered in GATE are mostly important so i think covering them would be enough.
 
The subjects and respective references are
